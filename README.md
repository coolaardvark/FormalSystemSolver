# FormalSystemSolver
My attempt to produce a generic Formal System solver based on the formal systems found in the first few chapters of Douglas R. Hofstadters epic book
Godel, Escher, Bach: an Enternal Golden Braid.
The code is currently far complete and is only targeted form the first formal system, the MU system from chapter 1.
